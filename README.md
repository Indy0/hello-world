Learning how to use GitHub and the GitHub Flow!

Hi! My name is Joshua, I also go by Indy. I am currently learning all about Data Analysis to become a Data Analyst very soon! 

I am planning to host portfolio projects here on GitHub while I'm learning SQL and showcase them to future job applications!
